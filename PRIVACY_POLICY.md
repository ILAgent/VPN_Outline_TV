# Privacy Policy for Native Outline VPN

**Last updated:** February 22, 2026

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Native Outline VPN** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application **Native Outline VPN** (the "App").

The App is a modified version of OutVPN TV version 1.1.3 (original author: Agolyud). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. **By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.**

**Developer:** IL_Agent  
**Original Repository:** [https://github.com/ILAgent/VPN_Outline_TV](https://github.com/ILAgent/VPN_Outline_TV)

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We believe in minimal data collection. **We do NOT collect, log, or store:**

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Browsing Activity** | Websites you visit, content you access, or files you download/upload |
| **Connection Logs** | Your original IP address, connection timestamps, or session duration |
| **DNS Queries** | Domain names you request — all DNS traffic is routed through the VPN tunnel |
| **Network Traffic** | Content of your communications or data packets |
| **Device Identifiers** | IMEI, Android ID, advertising ID, or similar persistent identifiers |
| **Personal Information** | Name, address, phone number, or contacts |

**We are a zero-logging VPN.** This means we have no information to share even if requested by third parties.

## 3. Information We Collect (Minimal and Necessary)

### 3.1. Local App Settings (Stored Only on Your Device)

To provide core functionality and user preferences, the following information is stored **locally on your device only** and is **never transmitted to us or any third party**:

- **VPN connection preferences** (e.g., server selection, protocol settings)
- **Per-app routing rules** (which apps should or should not use the VPN)
- **"Start on boot" preference**
- **List of installed apps** — used locally to display app selection for per-app routing (never transmitted or logged)

These settings:
- Are stored only on your device
- Can be deleted at any time via in-app settings or by uninstalling the App
- Are never transmitted to any server

### 3.2. Anonymous Usage Data (Optional)

We may collect **completely anonymous, non-personal** usage data to improve the App:

- **Crash reports** (anonymized technical information about app errors)
- **Basic usage statistics** (e.g., feature popularity, connection success rates)

This data **cannot** be linked to you personally. You can opt out of this collection at any time in the App settings.

## 4. App Permissions Explained

The App requires certain permissions to function. We only request permissions necessary for VPN operation:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **INTERNET** | To establish VPN connection and route your traffic |
| **BIND_VPN_SERVICE** | To create and maintain a secure VPN tunnel (core VPN functionality) |
| **ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** | To detect network changes and maintain connection stability |
| **RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** | To optionally start VPN on device boot (if you enable this feature) |
| **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES** | Used **locally only** to display installed apps for per-app routing settings — **never transmitted** |
| **WAKE_LOCK** | To prevent device sleep during active VPN connection |
| **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** | To keep VPN running in background (required by Android) |

**We do NOT request access to:**
- Contacts, camera, microphone, or sensors
- Location data (GPS)
- External storage or files
- SMS or call logs
- User accounts or credentials

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1. Distribution Platforms
The App is distributed through platforms like Google Play, GitHub, or F-Droid. These platforms may collect their own data according to their respective privacy policies. We have no control over their data collection.

### 5.2. No Analytics or Advertising
By default, the App **does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services**. If this changes in the future, we will:
- Update this Privacy Policy
- Provide clear notice within the App
- Offer an opt-out mechanism

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect any limited information we may collect:
- All VPN tunnels are encrypted
- Local app data is stored in private app storage, inaccessible to other apps
- We follow industry best practices for secure coding

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is **not intended for children under 13** (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your data:

- **Opt-out of Anonymous Usage Data:** You can disable anonymous usage collection in App settings
- **Data Deletion:** Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored settings
- **Access Requests:** Since we collect no personal information, there is nothing to access or delete from our servers

**To exercise any rights or ask questions:** [YOUR CONTACT EMAIL]

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App
